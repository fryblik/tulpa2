The unofficial CZ/SK Bronies Discord community bot.

## Tulpa... 2?
Tulpa is a project started back in 2017 as [a10](https://github.com/fryblik)'s
Python debut. Since 2020, one
[f](https://github.com/Aldenar)[r](https://github.com/ptrbroz)[i](https://github.com/eldan-dex)[e](https://github.com/alkel-u3)[n](https://github.com/tobyyy)[d](https://github.com/FrosterDune)
after another joined the effort to make Tulpa a versatile tool tailored to the
needs and internal humor of the CZ/SK Bronies unofficial Discord server. As of
mid-2023, the original Tulpa project boasted over 69 commands, Easter Eggs, and
moderation tools.

Tulpa spent his early years running on
[FI MUNI](https://www.fi.muni.cz/index.html.en)'s student server. After
graduating, he had to squeeze inside his owner's
[rooted vacuum cleaner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHsqb2poGII) for a few
months before finding his forever home in the cloud. Once upon a time, Tulpa
used to implement [ChatterBot](https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot). The
feature wasn't popular, though, and so he was lobotomized. In 2022,
[nextcord](https://github.com/nextcord/nextcord) replaced
[discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) as his Discord API wrapper of
choice.

Due to the presence of some properly *(wink wink)* licensed content, hardcoded
sensitive data, and dubious code quality (Tulpa was a learning experience for
many of us), the original [Tulpa](https://github.com/fryblik/tulpa) repository
was and will stay forever private. Eventually, though, Discord's shift towards
[slash commands](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands)
gave us the excuse to start rewriting Tulpa properly.

Enter Tulpa 2.
